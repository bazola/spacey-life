TODO UNIVERSE REGIONS:
star arm

IMPLEMENTED REGIONS
star cluster
dark zone with replenishing fog of war
nebula with lower star density

IMPLEMENTED
aliens now notice new flags, and also do not all move to the same flag
universe regions
the parallax sprites need to be sized based on screen size
add sounds
add sound for not enough money when purchasing



IDEA:
scroll pane of flags along the bottom
tap a flag to enable it, so you can choose how many flags
double tap to zoom to the flag

more ideas:
good/evil scale that depends on how many neutral ships you kill
asymetrical gameplay where there are aliens/traders/fighters and you can pick a side
flags and radar rings render above the fog of war
keep track of how many aliens are at each flag, provide a way for the player to decide priority


TODO
make camera movements smooth
add planets to the stars? could be visible on the map as an arc and orb, each additional planet being a bigger arc
change the flag to something that makes more sense thematically

randomize starting positions
currently the parallax moves differently depending on how the hud stage is stretched
