idea:
scroll pane of flags along the bottom
tap a flag to enable it, so you can choose how many flags
double tap to zoom to the flag

ai:
they need to constantly check the active flags so that they do not need
to complete the movement to a flag that is not there anymore

universe:
create concrete areas of the universe that have a "region" name as well as characteristics
nebula
galaxy center
star cluster
star arm
place with fog of war
These areas would be randomly generated during universe creation, and then there would
be an exploration/discovery element to the game.
